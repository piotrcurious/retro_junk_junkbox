Great question. Let's verify whether your VGA timing configuration is realistic for an ATmega2560 @ 16 MHz. You’ve configured:


---

🖥 VGA TIMING TARGETS

Your frame is 320×240 resolution — a common target for embedded VGA projects. Let's first review your timer configuration and compare it to standard VGA timings.


---

⏱ Timer1 – HSYNC

ICR1 = 640 - 1;         // Timer1 TOP = 639 → 640 cycles per scanline
OCR1A = 640 - 1;        // Trigger ISR at end of scanline
OCR1B = 640 - 96;       // HSYNC pulse width = 96 cycles

With TCCR1B = _BV(CS10), Timer1 runs at full system clock:

Clock: 16 MHz

Period: 640 cycles @ 16 MHz → 40 µs per scanline

That gives a line rate of:
1 / 40 µs = 25,000 lines/sec



---

🎞 Timer5 – VSYNC

ICR5 = 167680 - 1;  // Total lines per frame: 167680 cycles
OCR5A = 167680 - 1 - (167680 / 525);  // VSYNC pulse

Also with CS50, Timer5 runs at 16 MHz.

Total frame time = 167680 / 16e6 = 10.48 ms

Frame rate = ~95.4 Hz


→ That’s realistic and even higher than standard VGA (60 Hz). You are driving ~525 lines per frame (167680 / 320 ≈ 525), which is consistent with VGA 640×480 @ 60 Hz, but adapted to your 320×240 resolution.


---

🎨 Active Scan Time

You're using:

if (currentScanline >= 35 && currentScanline < (FRAMEBUFFER_HEIGHT + 35))

Visible area = 240 scanlines

VBLANK lines = 525 - 240 = 285 total

You're starting at line 35 and going up to 274 → that’s 240 active lines ✔



---

⏲ Pixel Clock (Timer3)

TCCR3A = _BV(COM3A0); // Toggle OC3A on compare match
TCCR3B = _BV(WGM32);  // CTC mode
OCR3A = 0;            // Compare match at 0

This toggles every 1 cycle, so frequency:

Pixel clock = 16 MHz / 2 = 8 MHz (toggle every cycle)

One pixel every 125 ns

Horizontal visible area = 320 pixels

Active time = 320 * 125 ns = 40 µs — perfect match with HSYNC period ✔


→ That confirms:

Pixel clock = 8 MHz

Horizontal scanline = 40 µs

Vertical frame = ~10.48 ms

Frame rate = ~95.4 Hz



---

✅ Is it realistic?

Yes, absolutely:

320×240 resolution

8 MHz pixel clock

40 µs per scanline

~95 Hz frame rate


This is realistic for the ATmega2560, given:

You avoid software-intensive pixel output (you’re streaming via SAM).

You use hardware timers and precise port access.

Data bandwidth is well below the DRAM access limit (if pipelined).

🔍 Considerations

💡 You have headroom to:

Lower frame rate to 60 Hz (standard VGA) → reduce CPU/VRAM load

Increase horizontal/vertical blanking time for compatibility

Or keep 95 Hz for smoother animation — entirely your call


🔧 Sync Polarity

Standard VGA uses negative sync. Be sure to invert OC1B and OC5A output logic levels if needed via COM1B1/COM5A1 bits or an external inverter.


🧪 Signal Quality

At 8 MHz pixel clock, PCB layout and signal drive strength are very important.

Use short wires, match impedance, and avoid long parallel data/control lines.
