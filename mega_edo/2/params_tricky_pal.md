Yes — let’s generate a CRT-friendly 320×240 VGA timing targeting 50 Hz, which is common in PAL regions and compatible with many CRT and older LCD monitors.

🎯 Goal: 50 Hz CRT-Compatible VGA Mode (Non-Interlaced)

✅ Design Constraints

Parameter	Target

Resolution	320×240
Pixel clock	~12.6 MHz (lowest reliable)
Horizontal rate	~31.25 kHz
Frame rate	50 Hz
Interlacing	❌ No (Progressive scan)


This is not VGA-standard 640×480@60Hz (which uses 25.175 MHz), but we’ll create a "mode within spec" that:

Matches CRT expectations for line and frame rates.

Stretches 320×240 into a 640×480 envelope with double-sized pixels.

🧮 Timing Breakdown

Horizontal Timing (Line: ~31.25 kHz @ ~12.6 MHz)

Let’s keep:

Component	Pixels	Time @ 12.6 MHz

Visible	320	25.4 µs
Front Porch	32	2.54 µs
Sync Pulse	96	7.62 µs
Back Porch	192	15.2 µs
Total	640	50.8 µs (~19.7 kHz if used alone) ❌


To reach 31.25 kHz line rate, total line must be:

1 / 31.25kHz = 32.0 µs → 32.0 µs × 12.6 MHz = 403.2 px

So instead, let's define a custom pixel clock:

Pixel clock = 403.2 px / 32.0 µs = **12.6 MHz**

So we’ll use 403 total pixels/line, with 320 visible.

Component	Pixels	Time @ 12.6 MHz

Visible	320	25.4 µs
Front Porch	16	1.27 µs
Sync Pulse	32	2.54 µs
Back Porch	35	2.78 µs
Total	403	32.0 µs

Vertical Timing (50 Hz Target)

To hit 50 Hz:

1 / 50 Hz = 20 ms frame
Lines/frame = 20 ms / 32 µs = 625 lines (matches PAL)

Component	Lines	Time

Visible	240	7.68 ms
Front Porch	8	0.256 ms
Sync Pulse	4	0.128 ms
Back Porch	373	11.94 ms
Total	625	20.0 ms ✔

✅ Summary: VGA CRT-Compatible Mode (PAL-like)

Parameter	Value

Resolution	320×240
Pixel Clock	12.6 MHz
HSYNC Rate	31.25 kHz
VSYNC Rate	50 Hz
Horizontal Time	32.0 µs
Frame Time	20.0 ms
Sync Polarity	Negative
Total Pixels	403×625

⚙️ Arduino Mega 2560 Setup (16 MHz System Clock)

To generate 12.6 MHz pixel clock from 16 MHz is not exact, but we can get close with a 1:1 CPU cycle ratio, skipping cycles as needed.

Workaround: Use 16 MHz pixel clock (overclocked)

Let’s use 16 MHz pixel clock for simplicity, then scale timing:

New line: 16 MHz × 32 µs = 512 pixels

We adjust the porch and sync lengths to maintain 50 Hz frame


Adjusted Horizontal Timing @ 16 MHz

Component	Pixels	Time

Visible	320	20.0 µs
Front Porch	32	2.0 µs
Sync Pulse	64	4.0 µs
Back Porch	96	6.0 µs
Total	512	32.0 µs ✔


Vertical Timing (50 Hz target)

625 lines × 32 µs = 20.0 ms ✔

⌨️ Arduino Timers Setup

Timer3 – Pixel Clock (optional)

// Skip if using PORT toggling

Timer1 – HSYNC

ICR1 = 512 - 1;          // 32 µs per line at 16 MHz
OCR1A = 511;
OCR1B = 512 - 64 - 96;   // Sync starts after front porch

Timer5 – VSYNC

ICR5 = 512 * 625 - 1;     // 20 ms
OCR5A = 512 * (625 - 4) - 1; // VSYNC 4 lines before frame end

ISR Scanline Range

if (currentScanline >= 108 && currentScanline < (240 + 108)) {
    ...
}


---

✅ Conclusion: CRT-Friendly 320×240@50Hz VGA Mode (PAL Compatible)

Pixel Clock: 16 MHz (simple, already present)

Line: 32 µs → 31.25 kHz

Frame: 625 lines → 50 Hz

Sync polarity: negative

Works well with PAL CRTs and compliant LCDs

Horizontal scaling to 640 is optional for better fill

Would you like a selector macro system to easily toggle between:

16 MHz @ 50 Hz (CRT-friendly)

8 MHz @ 60–95 Hz (normal)

4 MHz @ 20–30 Hz (low power LCD)?


I can generate a full #define-driven setup block.
